# Introduction

The following are the list of competitor who will be showcasing their games at the Penang International Science Fair 2023. Each link leads to the team's main game repository which will include the source code as well as the games themselves packaged as ready to play binaries.

We are proud of the effort the kids have put into making their games and polishing them over the duration of the program, and have no doubt all of them deserve to be called game developers, and no longer game developers in-training. Please show your support by playing their games!
